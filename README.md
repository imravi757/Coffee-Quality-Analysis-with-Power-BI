# Coffee Quality Analysis with Power BI

## Project Overview

This Power BI project analyzes coffee quality data from the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) to identify key factors that influence coffee quality scores. The dataset includes comprehensive information about coffee production, processing methods, sensory evaluations, and defect occurrences from various origin regions.

## Key Objectives

1. **Identify quality determinants**: Analyze sensory attributes (flavor, aroma, acidity, etc.) to determine their impact on overall coffee quality
2. **Explore processing-region correlations**: Investigate relationships between processing methods, origin regions, and quality scores
3. **Defect pattern analysis**: Examine trends in defect occurrences and their influence on quality
4. **Variable interactions**: Understand how different factors combine to affect Total Cup Points (the overall quality metric)

## Dataset Features

- **Sensory evaluations**: 10 quality metrics including Aroma, Flavor, Aftertaste, Acidity, Body, Balance, Uniformity, Clean Cup, and Sweetness
- **Defect classification**:
  - Category One: Visual defects (black beans, sour beans, insect damage)
  - Category Two: Taste defects (over-fermentation, staleness, rancidness)
- **Geographical data**: Country/region of origin
- **Processing methods**: Washed/wet, natural/dry, and experimental techniques

## Key Findings

- Flavor emerged as the most significant determinant of coffee quality
- Quality varies significantly by country of origin and processing method
- Defect reduction correlates strongly with quality improvement
- Sensory attributes interact complexly to influence Total Cup Points

## Technical Implementation

- Developed interactive dashboards with comprehensive visualizations
- Implemented key influencer analysis to identify quality drivers
- Created defect trend analysis with time-series components
- Designed "What-If" analysis scenarios for quality prediction

## How to Use

1. Download the Power BI file and dataset
2. Open the report to explore interactive visualizations
3. Use filters to examine specific regions, processing methods, or quality ranges
4. Explore the "What-If" analysis page to simulate quality impacts

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate additional data sources for climate/soil analysis
- Develop predictive models for quality scoring
- Expand processing method comparisons with newer techniques

This project provides valuable insights for coffee producers, processors, and quality evaluators to optimize their practices for better coffee quality outcomes.
